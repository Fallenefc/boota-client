However, I could not find any website or application that would allow me to create my own questions and quizzes and practice with them, so I had the idea to create my own so students would be able to create their own question bank and also create quizzes out of these questions. I figure out that would be extremely useful for teachers too, that especially during challenging pandemic times had to rely on online teaching. With quizilla, teachers can create their own question bank and their own quizzes to test their students."
